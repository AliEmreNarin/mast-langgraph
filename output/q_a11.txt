Looking at the provided context, I can see that the search results mention Ralph Lauren Corporation as "a publicly traded American fashion and lifestyle brand founded in 1967" [1], which fits the description of "an American multinational corporation that designs and manufactures upper market apparel for men, women and children."

The context also mentions Cindy Crawford with a birth date of "February 20, 1966" [1], and she is described as being associated with modeling.

However, the context is incomplete - it cuts off mid-sentence and doesn't explicitly confirm that Cindy Crawford has been featured in Ralph Lauren campaigns, which is crucial to answering the question accurately.
