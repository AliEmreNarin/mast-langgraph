FOLLOW_UP_QUERY: FireWire IEEE 1394 interface standard audio video data transmission protocol

The provided context mentions that FireWire is "an interface standard that specifies a transmission method, medium, and protocol" and is "ideal for digital audio, video and graphic applications" [1], but it doesn't specifically identify what interface standard FireWire cameras use. The context is cut off and doesn't provide the complete technical specification needed to answer the question.
