Looking at the provided context, I can see information about two different songs titled "Artificial Light":

1. A debut single by ALPHABET, described as a "London-based, Brighton-formed quartet" [1]
2. A single by American Christian metal band Demon Hunter [1]

Since the question asks about "the band that released the single Artificial Light" without specifying which one, and there are multiple bands with songs of this title, the context is insufficient to provide a definitive answer.

ANSWER: I don't know based on the context - there are multiple bands with songs titled "Artificial Light" mentioned, including ALPHABET (London-based, Brighton-formed) and Demon Hunter (American), but the question doesn't specify which single is being referenced.
