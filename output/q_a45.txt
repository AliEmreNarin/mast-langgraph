Looking at the provided context, I can see a reference to "Ms. Davis" being "wonderfully cast as the second Mrs. Ronald Reagan" in relation to the film "Talk About a Stranger" [1]. However, the context doesn't clearly identify who the female star of the film was or what specific political role she held.

The snippet mentions someone who became "the second Mrs. Ronald Reagan," which would be Nancy Reagan, but the context doesn't explicitly confirm this person was the female star of "Talk About a Stranger" or specify what political role she held.
