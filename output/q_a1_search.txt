This has now morphed into a popular Halloween game called apple on a string! Times have changed somewhat since then, so we have a more contemporary version of the game, in addition to the traditional one, which some adults might still like to try out! This game - like the apple on a string and apple bobbing - is a fortune telling game, and lots of fun for all the family!",

When I transitioned from trick-or-treating to college Halloween parties, the costume part stuck and the games really put spirit (of the liquid variety, mainly) into the holiday. Apple bobbing may not actually be an ancient practice, but it does definitely date back to before the 1800s in the British Isles where it was a dating game. Another staple of Halloween parties is racing to make friends into toilet paper mummies. Competitions to carve — or draw, for those too young to wield a blade — the best pumpkin are a fun Halloween tradition.",

So much so the WOC president proclaimed them “The best Games ever!” Alas, the witches’ timing was not as prescient as their highly vaunted ability to see the future. The Games were resurrected in 1480, held again in the Tyrol, considered by then the permanent home of the Witch Games.",
