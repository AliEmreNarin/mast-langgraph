Arnold's early life included struggles with academic dedication, but he developed a profound love for poetry, particularly influenced by the works of poets like Wordsworth. In his letters, Arnold criticized Clough’s poetry as overly topical and intellectual, but he also found fault with his own poems. A number of Arnold’s essays on literary topics were first delivered as lectures at Oxford University, where he was appointed for two five-year terms as professor of poetry. Although he was a gifted poet, Arnold stopped writing poetry and focused on prose criticism in his later years.",
