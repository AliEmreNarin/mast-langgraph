FOLLOW_UP_QUERY: Canadian military deaths World War 2 total casualties

The context mentions that Canada had "over 44,000 dead" in World War II [1] and that over 25,000 Canadian soldiers became casualties in the Italian campaign alone [1], but the information is incomplete and doesn't provide the total number of Canadian deaths in WWII (which is generally considered the deadliest conflict in absolute terms). A more comprehensive search is needed to get the complete figure.

FOLLOW_UP_QUERY: total Canadian deaths World War 2 complete statistics military civilian

The context provides conflicting and incomplete information. One source mentions "2,042 men and women of Canada's armed forces died during the war: 22,917 in the Canadian Army, 17,101 in the RCAF and 2,024 in the" [1] but this appears to be cut off and the numbers don't add up logically. Another source mentions "Canada: over 44,000 dead" [1] but this is also incomplete. I need more complete and reliable statistics on total Canadian deaths in World War II.
