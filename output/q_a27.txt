FOLLOW_UP_QUERY: Belinda Peregrín naturalized Mexican citizenship when did she become Mexican citizen

The context shows that Belinda Peregrín has dual citizenship in Spain and Mexico [1], and that she was born in Madrid, Spain [1]. However, it doesn't specify which country she was naturalized in - whether she was naturalized in Mexico (since she was born in Spain) or if there's another naturalization involved. A more specific search about her naturalization process is needed.
