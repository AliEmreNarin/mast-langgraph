Looking at the provided context, I can see that Professional Basketball Club LLC is headed by Clay Bennett [1], but the context doesn't provide information about what organization Clay Bennett serves as chairman emeritus of the board of directors.

The context only tells us that Professional Basketball Club LLC is "an investment group headed by Clay Bennett" and that it "owns the National Basketball Association (NBA)'s Oklahoma City Thunder franchise" [1]. However, it doesn't mention Dorchester Capital Corporation or any organization where Clay Bennett serves as chairman emeritus.

Looking at the provided context, I can see that Clay Bennett is listed as an "Emeritus Board Member" and "Dorchester Capital Emeritus Board Member" on what appears to be related to "Downtown OKC" and mentions "OKLAHOMA CITY INITIATIVES BOARD OF DIRECTORS" [1]. However, the context is fragmented and doesn't clearly state the complete name of the organization where Clay Bennett serves as chairman emeritus of the board of directors.

While there are hints pointing toward an Oklahoma City-related organization, the context doesn't provide a clear, complete answer to identify the specific organization.
