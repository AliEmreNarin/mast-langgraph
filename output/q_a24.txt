FOLLOW_UP_QUERY: British educator early 1900s influenced by Matthew Arnold and John Ruskin or other writers

The context mentions that Matthew Arnold had influence on T.S. Eliot and other poet-critics [1], but it doesn't identify the specific British educator from the turn of the twentieth century or reveal who else (besides Matthew Arnold) influenced this educator. The question seems to be asking for a second influential figure alongside Matthew Arnold.

FOLLOW_UP_QUERY: Charlotte Mason British educator Matthew Arnold John Ruskin influences turn of twentieth century

The context shows connections between Matthew Arnold and other writers like John Ruskin [1] and mentions that Arnold's educational ideas were inspired by Wordsworth [1], but it doesn't clearly identify the specific British educator from the turn of the twentieth century or definitively answer who else (besides Matthew Arnold) influenced this educator. The question appears to be asking about a specific historical figure and their influences.
