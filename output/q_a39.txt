ANSWER: I don't know based on the context

FOLLOW_UP_QUERY: Liars band formation date year

The provided context [1] only contains information about a Deaf Havana song and does not provide any information about when either the Liars or Mallory Knox bands were formed. To answer which band is older, I would need the formation dates of both bands. I'm proposing to search for Liars first, and then a separate query would be needed for Mallory Knox's formation date.

The context [1] provides information that Liars was formed in 2000, but there is no information about when Mallory Knox was formed. To determine which band is older, I need the formation date of Mallory Knox to compare it with Liars' 2000 formation date.
