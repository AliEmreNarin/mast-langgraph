  {"Preface": "I have built an agentic system through langgraph with Tavily as the search agent, and Claude-4 as the reasoning agent. Out of 50 questions (randomly sampled from the dataset) I chose to test, 42 were correct. 8 were incorrect.  Correct answers did not show an error in their agentic design. Wrong answers mainly due to the design of hotpot qa (Which is not an agentic benchmark, but a reasoning one). Q's 47, 41, 36, 24 where the agent gave a correct answers out of multiple correct answers but not the ground truth one specified in dataset. The other 4 mistakes are explained below. I would argue this benchmark is not a good fit for agentic benchmarks as it is not an agentic benchmark, but a reasoning benchmark."},
